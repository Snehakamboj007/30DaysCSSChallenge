# 30 Days CSS Challenge 

This repository is inspired by [Raquel LimÃ¢â€™s 30 Days CSS Challenge](https://github.com/RaquelLima7/30DaysOfCSS.git). Iâ€™ve added my own creativity and custom styles to make this a unique re-implementation.


I am participating in this challenge to Practice and improve my CSS skills. All projects are created by me by following the challenge instructions, and are for learning purposes only.

 # Day 1 - Project Name Here

Description:  
This is my first mini project from the 30-day CSS challenge. It demonstrates ("Animated Screen").

Day_01: Animated Screem
Inside the Day_01, you will find:
- `index.html` â€” the HTML structure
- `style.css` â€” the CSS styling
- `day01.gif` â€” visual representation
